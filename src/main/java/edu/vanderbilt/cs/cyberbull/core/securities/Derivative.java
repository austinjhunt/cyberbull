Derivative securities consist of some agreement to buy or sell an asset at a specific
price by some specific date. That asset may be a commodity, a property, or some other security.
Examples: futures contracts, mortgage-backed securities, swaps, forward contracts, or options.
Investors use this type of security for 1) hedging to offset risk or loss, or 2) speculation,
meaning you aim to profit off of price variances.
