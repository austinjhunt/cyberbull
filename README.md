This is a Java application built for a Vanderbilt University CS5278 (Principles of Software Engineering) final project. 
It's a reflection of my personal interest in the stock market and is an exploration of many [Gang of Four design 
patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) in the context of stocks and brokerage account management.  
The application makes heavy use of **object-oriented** programming techniques for **structure and organization**, as 
well as **functional** programming techniques to draw **clear connections** between the **domain intent** (brokerage account 
management) and the **computation**.
